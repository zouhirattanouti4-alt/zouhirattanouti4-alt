## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **software engineering student** passionate about building **real-world applications**, not just writing code for assignments.

I enjoy working on projects where I can **design an idea, structure it properly, and bring it to life** — from low-level logic to interactive and visual experiences.

🧠 What defines my mindset:
- I focus on **modular architecture**, clean code, and maintainability  
- I like transforming **abstract concepts into tangible products**  
- I learn best by **building, breaking, and improving real projects**

🎯 Current interests:
- Software development & system-level programming  
- Artificial Intelligence & DevOps fundamentals  
- Cloud technologies and modern software workflows

## 🧩 What I Work On

- 🎮 Interactive applications & games (graphics, logic, performance)
- ⚙️ Structured academic & personal projects with real use cases
- 🧪 Experimenting with new technologies and engineering practices
- 🤝 Collaborative projects using Git & GitHub
